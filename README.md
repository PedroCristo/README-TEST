## User Experience - UX

 ### User Stories

* As a website creator, I want to:
  
1. Build a online quiz that is visually appealing from the user’s first visit so they are intrigued to explore and play the game.
2. Build an easy to navigate and play the game for its users.
   
* As a new visitor, I want to:

1. be able to understand the main purpose of the game.
2. Be able to easily navigate throughout the game and choose a quiz to play.
3. Be able to easily access to the game social media pages.
   
* As a returning visitor, I want to:

1. Be able to find new quizzes when they will be available.
2. Be able to check the Height Scores page
3. be able to challenge myself and improve on my scores.
   
## Design

### Wireframe
In this project I decided to build a prototype, using the tool Canva, before start work on the code. It was helpful for UI perspective as I could display the different elements 
in the screen and worked with them with the objective to build an application that would be easily used by the users.<br>

### Website Structure
The Quiz Land is a seven pages website has been designed to look like an application in small devices.

* HigH Scores <br>

#### Colour Scheme
 ![Color Scheme](./assets/images/readme/color-pallete.png)<br>
 The main colour scheme I chosen for this project is overall blue tones and purple with a darker colour for maximum user accessibility. I have choose a green color as interactive-color to make contrats with the background.

#### Typography
* The Roboto, sans-serif is used as the main font for the whole website.
      
#### Imagery
* 3 background images were used for the game pages.

### Interactive Links  
* At the bottom of the Home page, users can access the game social media links (Facebook and Instagram). Once these icons are clicked they are opened in a new tab.
