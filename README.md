## Design

#### Colours

![Colours Palete](./assets/readme/extras/watches_clocks_color_palete.png)<br>

- The colour scheme is kept simple by opting for a combination of white text set against the image
  background and black text against the white background. The navbar was set on a white background
  and a light grey on the bottom. The interactive colour is used for icons and the website logo.
  Yellow and red are used for the buttons to buy and see product details. The dark grey for to website
  footer contrasts with the rest of the website.

#### Typography

- The Montserrat font is used as the main font for the whole project and the Kaushan font is used to
  display the website logo.

- All the images, were converted to webp format to improve the website performance. The product images and
  banners are uploaded through the admin panel. The image banners are available in two different sizes to
  be displayed on desktop and mobile.

#### Video

- They are 2 videos playing as a background on the landing page, one is displaying on the desktop another one is on mobile.
  They were both compressed to improve the website's performance.
