## User Experience - UX

 ### User Stories

* As a website creator, I want to:
  
1. Build a online quiz that is visually appealing from the userâ€™s first visit so they are intrigued to explore and play the game.
2. Build an easy to navigate and play the game for its users.
   
* As a new visitor, I want to:

1. be able to understand the main purpose of the game.
2. Be able to easily navigate throughout the game and choose a quiz to play.
3. Be able to easily access to the game social media pages.
   
* As a returning visitor, I want to:

1. Be able to find new quizzes when they will be available.
2. Be able to check the Height Scores page
3. be able to challenge myself and improve on my scores.
   
## Design

### Wireframe
In this project I decided to build a prototype, using the tool Canva, before start work on the code. It was helpful for UI perspective as I could display the different elements 
in the screen and worked with them with the objective to build an application that would be easily used by the users.<br>

### Website Structure
The Quiz Land is a seven pages website has been designed to look like an application in small devices.

* HigH Scores <br>

#### Colour Scheme
 ![Color Scheme](./assets/images/readme/color-pallete.png)<br>
 The main colour scheme I chosen for this project is overall blue tones and purple with a darker colour for maximum user accessibility. I have choose a green color as interactive-color to make contrats with the background.

#### Typography
* The Roboto, sans-serif is used as the main font for the whole website.
      
#### Imagery
* 3 background images were used for the game pages.

### Interactive Links  
* At the bottom of the Home page, users can access the game social media links (Facebook and Instagram). Once these icons are clicked they are opened in a new tab.
