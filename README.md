## User Experience - UX

 ### User Stories

* As a website creator, I want to:
  
1. Build a online quiz that is visually appealing from the user’s first visit so they are intrigued to explore and play the game.
2. Build an easy to navigate and play the game for its users.
3. Build a quiz that is both enjoyable and challenging for the user.
   
* As a new visitor, I want to:

1. be able to understand the main purpose of the game.
2. Be able to easily navigate throughout the game and choose a quiz to play.
3. Be able to see my results after playing the game.
   
* As a returning visitor, I want to:

1. Be able to find new quizzes when they will be available.
2. Be able to check the Height Scores page
3. be able to challenge myself and improve on my scores.
   
## Design

### Wireframe
In this project I decided to build a prototype using the tool Canva before start work on the code. It was helpful for UI perspective as I could display the different elements 
in the screen and worked with them with the objective to build an application that would be easily used by the users.<br>
